## üöÄ My Edge: Why I Stand Out

Here are some highlights that showcase my dedication, problem-solving abilities, and potential:

* [cite_start]**LinkedIn Coachin Mentee (Top 1%)**: Selected as one of the **top 80 mentees** from over **10,000 applicants across India** for LinkedIn's prestigious Coachin Program[cite: 41]. [cite_start]This demonstrates strong problem-solving and technical skills, and I receive personalized mentorship from LinkedIn engineers, with direct access to LinkedIn's Summer Internship interview[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Academic Excellence (Perfect 10 CGPA)**: Achieved a **perfect 10/10 CGPA** in my first semester of B.Tech at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (2023-2024), ranking **jointly highest in the entire batch**[cite: 57]. [cite_start]My overall CGPA is 9.47/10[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**SheFi Scholar & Global Collaboration**: Awarded a **fully-paid scholarship** to SheFi's competitive 8-week program, focusing on Web3 and crypto education[cite: 44]. [cite_start]I collaborated within a global community of over 3,000 members across 90+ countries, fostering invaluable networking in the Web3 ecosystem[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Top 1% in CBSE Board Exams 2023**: Consistently performed at the highest level academically, placing among the top 1 percentile of students in the CBSE Board Exams 2023[cite: 58].

## üíª What I'm Building & Mastering

I'm passionate about translating theoretical knowledge into practical solutions and continuously expanding my skillset.

* [cite_start]**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Enthusiast**: Currently immersing myself in advanced DSA concepts to build a strong foundation for efficient problem-solving[cite: 55]. [cite_start]I've completed a comprehensive DSA course from Coding Blocks[cite: 55].
* **Aspiring Full Stack Developer**: Eagerly diving into core web development technologies, including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**, to create dynamic and responsive user experiences.

### Featured Projects:

* [cite_start]**FEW SHOT LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC KEYWORD SPOTTING SYSTEM** (Smart India Hackathon 2024) [cite: 29][cite_start]: Proposed an innovative solution to identify and classify keywords of interest in an audio file even when very few samples are provided for training[cite: 30]. [cite_start]The approach involved training a neural network on a large multilingual dataset and then applying transfer learning for specific keywords[cite: 31, 32].
* [cite_start]**COSMETICS SHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** [cite: 33][cite_start]: Developed a comprehensive system to streamline inventory and customer management[cite: 34]. [cite_start]This project included features for adding, viewing, and removing cosmetic products[cite: 35].
    * [cite_start]**Technologies**: Python, MySQL [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]**HANDWRITTEN DIGITS CLASSIFICATION ON MNIST DATASET** [cite: 36][cite_start]: Implemented popular machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbour and Convolutional Neural Networks to accurately classify handwritten digits present in the MNIST dataset[cite: 38].
